1. Install the **Grid Emperor** Forex trading robot on your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Set up the currency pairs you want to trade by modifying the `currencyPairs` array in the code.
3. Define the risk levels and position sizes for each currency pair by modifying the `riskLevels` and `positionSizes` arrays in the code.
4. Customize the trading strategy and algorithm according to your requirements (code not provided).
5. Run the **Grid Emperor** trading robot on your MetaTrader 5 platform.

Please note that this code only provides a framework for executing trades based on market conditions. The actual trading strategy and algorithm are not provided in this code and should be developed separately.

## Code Explanation

The provided code consists of the following main components:

1. **Currency Pairs**: The `currencyPairs` array defines the currency pairs for trading. Modify this array to include the desired currency pairs.

2. **Trading Strategy and Algorithm**: The trading strategy and algorithm are not provided in this code and should be developed separately.

3. **Risk Levels and Position Sizes**: The `riskLevels` array defines the risk levels for each currency pair, and the `positionSizes` array defines the corresponding position sizes. Modify these arrays to adjust the risk and position sizes according to your preferences.

4. **Main Function**: The `OnTick` function is the main function for executing trades. It loops through each currency pair, checks the market conditions using the `CheckMarketConditions` function, and if the conditions are met, calculates the position size using the `CalculatePositionSize` function and executes the trade using the `ExecuteTrade` function.

5. **Market Conditions**: The `CheckMarketConditions` function is a placeholder function that always returns true. You should replace this function with your own market analysis and decision-making algorithm.

6. **Position Size Calculation**: The `CalculatePositionSize` function calculates the position size based on the risk level and position size defined for the currency pair.

7. **Trade Execution**: The `ExecuteTrade` function is a placeholder function that displays the trade details. You should replace this function with your own trade execution code.
